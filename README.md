# Update-Chrome-Driver

This is a powershell script that has two main purposes:

1) set up the system path environmental variable for ChromeDriver.exe to be able to run this from whatever location (**Needs admin access rights for that**)
2) get the corresponding version of Chrome driver for the installed Chrome browser

## Arguments

You can supply a directory path if you don't want to use the default one: `"C:\WebDriver\bin\"`
